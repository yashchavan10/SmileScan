## Introduction

In rural areas, common dental anxieties and limited transportation options deter people from seeking timely care, leading to neglected early signs of dental issues. SmileScan aims to address this problem by providing an accessible, user-friendly system for early dental issue detection.

## Features

- **Image Capture**: A physical camera device captures oral images and stores them in a database.
- **Web Application**: Integrated with a classifier to diagnose dental issues and provide a questionnaire for additional information.
- **Preliminary Medical Report**: Combines image analysis and questionnaire responses to generate a report with diagnosis and temporary relief recommendations.
- **Medication Dispensing**: Administered by pharmacists based on the generated report.

## System Architecture

1. **Image Capture**: A high-resolution camera device captures images of the patient's oral cavity, along with a desktop application which is used to capture the image
2. **Data Storage**: Images are stored securely in a database.
3. **Web Application**: Interfaces with the classifier and questionnaire module.
4. **Diagnosis**: Utilizes machine learning models to classify dental conditions into six types.

## Technology Stack

- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-End**: Django
- **Database**: MongoDB/SQL
